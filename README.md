# VisionResearch: Facial Recognition System

## Overview
VisionResearch is a cutting-edge facial recognition system developed using TensorFlow and leveraging the MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient and accurate identification of human faces. This project demonstrates the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in extracting facial features and generating embeddings that can be used for a wide range of applications, from security systems to personalized customer experiences.

## Features
- High accuracy face detection with MTCNN.
- Robust facial feature extraction using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.
- Modular and easily extendable codebase for further development and integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before you begin:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip and virtualenv

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visionresearch.git
    cd visionresearch
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
    - Create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
