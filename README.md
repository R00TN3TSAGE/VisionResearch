# VisionResearch: Facial Recognition System

## Overview
VisionResearch is a cutting-edge facial recognition system leveraging TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 architecture. This project showcases the capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract facial features and generate embeddings for applications ranging from security systems to personalized user experiences.

## Features
- **High Accuracy Face Detection**: Utilizes MTCNN for precise face detection.
- **Robust Facial Feature Extraction**: Employs a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for feature extraction.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is structured for easy extension and further development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/R00TN3TSAGE/VisionResearch.git
cd visionresearch
\`\`\`

#### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Create and activate a virtual environment:

- **macOS/Linux**:
  \`\`\`bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  \`\`\`

- **Windows**:
  \`\`\`bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
  \`\`\`

#### Install Dependencies
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## Usage
Navigate to the \`/src\` directory and run the main script:
\`\`\`bash
python face_recognition.py
\`\`\`
This script processes images in the \`/images\` directory, detecting faces and generating embeddings.
